Loading and preprocessing the data
Unzip the folder and read in the data in the activity.csv file.

if (!file.exists('activity.csv')) {
  unzip(zipfile = "activity.zip")
}

activityData <- read.csv(file="activity.csv", header=TRUE)
What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
# Calculate the total steps taken per day
totalSteps <- aggregate(steps ~ date, activityData, FUN=sum)

# Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken per day
hist(totalSteps$steps,
     main = "Total Steps per Day",
     xlab = "Number of Steps")

# Calculate and report the mean and median of total steps taken per day
meanSteps <- mean(totalSteps$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
medSteps <- median(totalSteps$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
Mean Number of Steps Taken per Day = 1.076618910^{4}
Median Number of Steps Taken per Day = 10765
What is the average daily activity pattern?
# Make a time-series plot of the 5-minute interval and the average number of
# steps taken, averaged acoss all days.
library(ggplot2)

# Which 5-minute interval across all days contain the maximum number of steps

Imputing Missing Values
# Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset
missingVals <- is.na(activityData$steps)

# Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values
There are 17568 missing values. I will replace these missing values with the 5-day average of that respective interval.

# Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with 
# the missing data filled in.

There is a difference of 0 in the mean steps of the two dataset. There is a difference of -1.076381110^{4} in the median steps of the two dataset. There is a difference of 8.612950910^{4} in the total steps of the two dataset.

Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
# Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels - "weekend" and "weekday"

      return ("weekeday")
  else if (day %in% c('Saturday', 'Sunday'))
      return ("weekend")
  else
      stop ("Invalid Date Format.")
}
imp_activityData$date <- as.Date(imp_activityData$date)
imp_activityData$day <- sapply(imp_activityData$date, FUN = DayType)

# Make a panel plot containnig a time-series plot of the 5-minute interval
# and the average number of steps taken across all weekdays or weekends
meanStepsByDay <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + day, imp_activityData, mean)
ggplot(data = meanStepsByDay, aes(x = interval, y = steps)) + 
  geom_line() +
